    <p>
      This Website is hosted on <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>. When you visit the Website, GitHub may process technical

    <hr>

    <h2>3) No analytics / no tracking cookies</h2>
    <p>
      I do not use analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics), advertising networks, tracking pixels, or similar technologies on this Website.
      The Website itself does not set tracking cookies.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Note: As hosting provider, GitHub may process technical log data as described above. If you follow external links,
      the respective providers’ privacy notices apply.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>4) Google Fonts (external resource)</h2>
    <p>
      This Website uses <strong>Google Fonts</strong> loaded from Google domains (e.g., <code>fonts.googleapis.com</code> /
      <code>fonts.gstatic.com</code>). When your browser loads these fonts, it makes a request to Google servers.
      This may transmit technical data such as your IP address and browser information as part of the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Google, the Google Fonts Web API does not set cookies and is designed to limit the collection, storage,
      and use of end-user data.
      For details, see: <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy">Google Fonts: Privacy and Data Collection</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      If you prefer to avoid any third-party requests when visiting this Website, you can block requests to Google Fonts
      in your browser or network settings. I may switch to self-hosted fonts in the future to further minimize third-party data sharing.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>5) Contacting me</h2>
    <p>
      If you contact me (e.g., by email), I will process the information you provide (such as your name, email address,
      and message content) solely to respond to your inquiry. I will keep such communications only as long as needed
      for handling the request and any follow-up.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>6) Your rights</h2>
    <p>
      Under Swiss data protection law, you may have rights such as requesting access to personal data about you,
      requesting correction, and—where applicable—requesting deletion. To exercise your rights, please contact me
      using the details in the <a href="imprint.html">Imprint</a>.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>7) Changes to this notice</h2>
    <p>
      I may update this Privacy Notice if the Website changes (e.g., if I add or remove third-party services).
      The “Last updated” date at the top indicates the most recent version.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      Reference: Switzerland expects websites to provide a comprehensible privacy statement, and the revised Swiss
      Federal Act on Data Protection has applied since 01 September 2023.
