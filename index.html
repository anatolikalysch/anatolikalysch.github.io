		<p>
  I’m a seasoned cybersecurity professional with experience spanning both hands-on technical work and executive leadership. Since 2016, I’ve worked across roles such as penetration testing and security research, and I later moved into managerial and strategic positions including CISO and Deputy CSO responsibilities -- always with a focus on building security that works in the real world.
  <br><br>
  Since 2020, my core focus has been building and scaling cybersecurity programs and helping organizations mature their security capabilities. As CISO at <a href="https://deutschebahnconnect.com/">Deutsche Bahn Connect GmbH</a>, and later as SISO and Deputy CSO at <a href="https://www.taurushq.com/">Taurus SA</a>, I’ve led end-to-end program development -- from defining strategy and governance to driving execution, measurement, and continuous improvement. Today, I serve as CISO at <a href="https://www.lindenhofgruppe.ch/de/">Lindenhofgruppe</a> in Bern.
  <br><br>
  Alongside industry work, I’ve been teaching cybersecurity since 2017. I regularly deliver courses in cybersecurity (see below for full list) -- ranging from IT forensics and reverse engineering to organizational cybersecurity -- most recently at the <a href="https://www.ffhs.ch/de/ffhs/personen/person/kalysch-anatoli">Fernfachhochschule Schweiz</a>.
  <br><br>
  I care about pragmatic security: translating technical risk into clear decisions, building sustainable structures, and enabling teams to deliver securely without slowing down the business.
