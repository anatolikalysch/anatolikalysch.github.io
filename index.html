		<p>
  I am a Senior Information Security Officer and Deputy Chief Security Officer at <a href="https://www.taurushq.com/">Taurus SA</a> in Geneva, with extensive experience in information security leadership. Previously, I served as Chief Information Security Officer at <a href="https://www.deutschebahnconnect.com/de">Deutsche Bahn Connect GmbH</a> and as a cybersecurity researcher at the IT Security Infrastructures Lab at <a href="https://www.cs1.tf.fau.de/person/anatoli-kalysch/">Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg</a>. In parallel, I actively teach cybersecurity and mobile security topics at universities of applied sciences like <a href="https://www.mannheim.dhbw.de/en/home">DHBW Mannheim</a> and others. 
<br><br>
  My professional focus lies in the design and rollout of enterprise-wide security programs aligned with ISO 27001, ISAE 3402, and regulatory frameworks like DORA and NIS2. I have led multiple successful ISO 27001:2022 certification initiatives and implemented security maturity programs based on CMMI, enabling organizations to benchmark and improve their security posture across people, processes, and technologies. This includes third-party risk management, business continuity planning, and building audit-ready compliance structures for fast-moving financial and cloud-based environments.
  I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science, and several internationally recognized certifications, including CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional), CISM (Certified Information Security Manager), and CIPM (Certified Information Privacy Manager). These credentials reflect both my technical depth and my understanding of data protection and privacy governance at an enterprise level.
  <br><br>
  I combine deep technical knowledge with clear communication, enabling me to drive security strategies that are pragmatic, risk-aligned, and understandable across executive and technical audiences alike.
